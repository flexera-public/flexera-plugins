Name: NSX - Firewall Demo (CSXgen2LAB)
Description: |
  Base ServerTemplate for RightLink10. RightLink10 is a new agent to connect
  servers to the RightScale platform that is very lightweight and simple to
  install. _It is not a plug-in upgrade from the older RightLink v6 or prior
  versions._ See [http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html](http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html)
  for details.

  This base ST includes a few boot scripts that:

  * Wait for an EIP to settle (AWS only)
  * Sets up a valid hostname
  * Configures NTP if not configured
  * Enables RightScale OS monitoring
  * Sets up RightLink10 automatic upgrades
  * Enables Docker support

  It has an operational script to force a RightLink10 upgrade. And we also
  provide a decommission script that provides the reason for shutdown. The
  source of the scripts on this ServerTemplate is available at
  [https://github.com/rightscale/rightlink_scripts/tree/10.6.0](https://github.com/rightscale/rightlink_scripts/tree/10.6.0).

Alerts:
- Name: rs instance terminated
  Description: Raise an alert if the instance has been terminated abnormally, i.e.
    not through the RightScale interface or by an elasticity daemon resizing server
    arrays.
  Clause: If RS/server.state == terminated for 1 minutes Tlshen escalate critical
- Name: rs instance stranded
  Description: Raise an alert if the instance enters the stranded state.
  Clause: If RS/server-failure.state == stranded for 1 minutes Then escalate warning
- Name: rs instance not responding
  Description: Raise an alert if the instance fails to send monitoring information
    for 5 minutes.
  Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-idle.value == NaN for 5 minutes Then escalate critical
- Name: rs cpu busy
  Description: Raise an alert if the idle time is too low.
  Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-idle.value < 15 for 3 minutes Then escalate warning
- Name: rs cpu overloaded
  Description: Raise an alert when the cpu idle time is too low.
  Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-idle.value < 3 for 5 minutes Then escalate critical
- Name: rs cpu I/O wait
  Description: Raise an alert if disk io is too high.
  Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-wait.value > 40 for 15 minutes Then escalate warning
- Name: rs low space in root partition
  Description: Raise an alert if the available space in the root partition is too
    low. This alert may be modified on an instance to match the metric name df/df-root.free
    instead if the instance is running collectd 4. See the RL10 Linux Setup Alerts
    RightScript (rll/setup-alerts.sh) for more details.
  Clause: If df-root/df_complex-free.value < 1073741824 for 5 minutes Then escalate
    critical
- Name: rs high network tx activity
  Description: Raise an alert if the amount of network data transmitted is too high.
    This alert may be modified or cloned on an instance to match the actual network
    interfaces that are present. See the RL10 Linux Setup Alerts RightScript (rll/setup-alerts.sh)
    for more details.
  Clause: If interface-eth0/if_octets.tx > 10000000 for 10 minutes Then escalate critical
- Name: rs high network rx activity
  Description: Raise an alert if the amount of network data received is too high.
    This alert may be modified or cloned on an instance to match the actual network
    interfaces that are present. See the RL10 Linux Setup Alerts RightScript (rll/setup-alerts.sh)
    for more details.
  Clause: If interface-eth0/if_octets.rx > 50000000 for 30 minutes Then escalate critical
