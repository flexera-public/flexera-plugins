# AWS Compute Plugin

## Overview

The AWS Compute Plugin integrates Flexera Self-Service with the basic functionality of the AWS Compute.

## Prerequisites

This plugin uses [credentials](https://docs.flexera.com/flexera/EN/Automation/ManagingCredentialsExternal.htm) for connecting to the cloud -- in order to apply this plugin you must have a credential registered in the system that is compatible with this plugin. If there are no credentials listed when you apply the plugin, please contact your cloud admin and ask them to register a credential that is compatible with this plugin. The information below should be consulted when creating the credential.

## Requirements

- A general understanding CAT development and definitions
  - Refer to the guide documentation for details [SS Guides](http://docs.rightscale.com/ss/guides/)
- Admin rights to a Flexera account with SelfService enabled
  - Admin is needed to set/retrieve the Flexera Credentials for the Compute API.
- The following packages are also required (See the Installation section for details):
  - [sys_log](../../libraries/sys_log.rb)

## Installation

1. Be sure your Flexera account is SelfService enabled
1. Follow the Getting Started section to create a Service Account and Flexera Credentials
1. Navigate to the appropriate SelfService portal
   - For more details on using the portal review the [SS User Interface Guide](http://docs.rightscale.com/ss/guides/ss_user_interface_guide.html)
1. In the Design section, use the `Upload CAT` interface to complete the following:
   1. Upload each of packages listed in the Requirements Section
   1. Upload the `aws_compute_plugin.rb` file located in this repository

## How to Use

The Compute Plugin has been packaged as `plugin/rs_aws_compute`. In order to use this plugin you must import this plugin into a CAT.

```ruby

import "plugin/rs_aws_compute"
```

For more information on using packages, please refer to the Flexera online documentation. [Importing a Package](http://docs.rightscale.com/ss/guides/ss_packaging_cats.html#importing-a-package)

AWS Compute resources can now be created by specifying a resource declaration with the desired fields. See the Supported Actions section for a full list of supported actions.
The resulting resource can be manipulated just like the native Flexera resources in RCL and CAT. See the Examples Section for more examples and complete CAT's.

## Supported Resources

- vpc
- endpoint
- route_table
- nat_gateway
- addresses
- tags

## Usage

```ruby

#Creates an VPC
resource "my_vpc", type: "rs_aws_compute.vpc" do
  cidr_block "10.0.0.0/16"
  instance_tenancy "default"
end

resource "my_vpc_endpoint", type: "rs_aws_compute.endpoint" do
  vpc_id @my_vpc.vpcId
  service_name "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3"
end

resource "my_rs_vpc", type: "rs_cm.network" do
  name "my_rs_vpc"
  cidr_block "10.0.0.0/16"
  cloud_href "/api/clouds/1"
end

resource "my_rs_vpc_endpoint", type: "rs_aws_compute.endpoint" do

| encrypted | No | Specifies whether the volume should be encrypted. Encrypted Amazon EBS volumes may only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are automatically encrypted. There is no way to create an encrypted volume from an unencrypted snapshot or vice versa. If your AMI uses encrypted volumes, you can only launch it on supported instance types. For more information, see Amazon EBS Encryption in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.  |

| kms_key_id | No | An identifier for the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to use when creating the encrypted volume. This parameter is only required if you want to use a non-default CMK; if this parameter is not specified, the default CMK for EBS is used. If a KmsKeyId is specified, the Encrypted flag must also be set.  |
| size | No | The size of the volume, in GiBs. |
| snapshot_id | No | The snapshot from which to create the volume. |
| volume_type | No | The volume type. This can be gp2 for General Purpose SSD, io1 for Provisioned IOPS SSD, st1 for Throughput Optimized HDD, sc1 for Cold HDD, or standard for Magnetic volumes.  |

## Implementation Notes

- The AWS Compute Plugin makes no attempt to support non-AWS resources. (i.e. Allow the passing the Flexera or other resources as arguments to an VPC resource.)
- The most common example might be to pass a Flexera instance to attach it to the VPC or similar. Support for this functionality will need to be implemented in the application CAT.

Full list of possible actions can be found on the [AWS Compute API Documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html)

## Examples

Please review [compute_instance_test_cat.rb](./compute_instance_test_cat.rb) for a basic example implementation.
