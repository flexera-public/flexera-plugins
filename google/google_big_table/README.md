# GCP Bigtable Plugin

## Overview
The GCP Bigtable Plugin consumes the Google Bigtable Admin API and exposes the supported resources to RightScale Self-Service. This allows for easy extension of a Self-Service Cloud Application to create, delete, and manage Bigtable resources.

## Requirements
- A general understanding CAT development and definitions
  - Refer to the guide documentation for details [SS Guides](http://docs.rightscale.com/ss/guides/)
- `admin`, `ss_enduser`, & `ss_designer` roles on a RightScale account with Self-Service enabled
  - the `admin` role is needed to set/retrieve the RightScale Credentials for the GCP Bigtable Admin API.
- GCP Service Account credentials
  - Refer to the Getting Started section for details on creating this account.
- The following RightScale Credentials must exist with the appropriate values
  - `GOOGLE_BIGTABLE_PLUGIN_ACCOUNT`
  - `GOOGLE_BIGTABLE_PLUGIN_PRIVATE_KEY`
- The following packages are also required (See the Installation section for details):
  - [sys_log](sys_log.rb)

## Getting Started
### Creating a GCP Service Account
This procedure will create a GCE Service account with the appropriate permissions to use this plugin.
1. Review the [Using OAuth 2.0 for Server to Server Applications](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount) documentation.
1. Follow the section named _Creating a service account_
    - Roles needs to include:
      - `bigtable.admin`
    - Permissions can be restricted but may effect the permissions required to interact with certain resources with this plugin. Doing so is unsupported
   - Enabling G Suite Domain-wide Delegation is not required
   - Furnish a new private key selecting the JSON option
1. Download the Private Key and record the Service account ID (These will be stored in a RightScale Credential in a future step)
### Creating the RightScale Credentials
This procedure will setup the Credentials required for the Bigtable Plugin to interact with the Bigtable Admin API
1. Review the [Credentials](http://docs.rightscale.com/cm/dashboard/design/credentials/index.html) documentation.
1. Create a credential in the desired RightScale Account with the name of `GOOGLE_BIGTABLE_PLUGIN_ACCOUNT`
1. Paste the Service Account Id into the value of this credential and save
1. Extract/Copy the private_key from the JSON downloaded when you created the GCE Service Account
   - You will need to replace "\n" in the private_key with actual line returns to paste into the credential 
1. Create a credential in the desired RightScale Account with the name of `GOOGLE_BIGTABLE_PLUGIN_PRIVATE_KEY`
1. Paste the private_key into the value of the credential making sure to replace "\n" with actual line returns and save

## Installation
1. Be sure your RightScale account has Self-Service enabled
1. Follow the Getting Started section to create a Service Account and RightScale Credentials
1. Navigate to the appropriate Self-Service portal
   - For more details on using the portal review the [SS User Interface Guide](http://docs.rightscale.com/ss/guides/ss_user_interface_guide.html)
1. In the Design section, use the `Upload CAT` interface to complete the following:
   1. Upload each of packages listed in the Requirements Section
   1. Upload the `gcp_bigtable_plugin.rb` file located in this repository
 
## How to Use
The Bigtable Plugin has been packaged as `plugins/bigtable`. In order to use this plugin you must import this plugin into a CAT.
```
import "plugins/bigtable"
```
For more information on using packages, please refer to the RightScale online documenataion. [Importing a Package](http://docs.rightscale.com/ss/guides/ss_packaging_cats.html#importing-a-package)

## Implementation Notes
- The Bigtable Plugin makes no attempt to support non-Bigtable resources. (i.e. Allow the passing the RightScale or other resources as arguments to a Bigtable resource.) 
- The Bigtable Plugin only interacts with the [Bigtable REST Admin API](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/reference/admin/rest/) and does not interact with any other Google Cloud API.

## Supported Resources
 - instances
 - clusters
 - tables

## Usage
```
resource "my_instance", type: "bigtable.instances" do
    instance_id join(["rs-",last(split(@@deployment.href, "/"))])
    instance do {
        "displayName" => "rs-instance",
        "type" => "PRODUCTION"
    } end
    clusters do {
      "my_cluster" => {
        "location" => join(["projects/", $google_project, "/locations/us-central1-c"]),
        "serveNodes" => 3,
        "defaultStorageType => "HDD"
      }
    } end 
end 

resource "my_cluster", type: "bigtable.clusters" do
    instance_id join(["rs-",last(split(@@deployment.href, "/"))])
    cluster_id join(["rs-cluster-",last(split(@@deployment.href, "/"))])
end

resource "my_table", type: "bigtable.tables" do
    instance_id join(["rs-",last(split(@@deployment.href, "/"))])
    table_id join(["table",last(split(@@deployment.href, "/"))])
end
```
